List is a special type in Java called an interface.
Arraylist is  resizable . It is a class.
<> - Domino Operator
ArrayList<String> str = new ArrayList<>()

add() - To add an elem
add(index_number,item) - To add elements at a specific index
addAll(List of elems)
List.of() -immutable and Arrays.asList()- mutable, are both methods in Java that can be used to create a list from a set of elements. However, there are some important differences.



get(index) - to get an element on that idex
set() - To change an item
remove(index) - to remove an element
contains(item) - Boolean which gives us if there is an item or not
indexOf() - gives the index of an element , -1 if not found
lastIndexOf() - Last index of an element (for repetating items)

removeAll(list of elems) - removes multiple elements
retainAll(list of items) - retains these elems n deletes all. if an item passed to retain is not in the list, it is just ignored and not added to the list.
clear() - empties the list
isempty()- returns true if the list is empty

Arrays.sort()- is a static method in Java's Arrays class that is used to sort an array in ascending order
arr.sort(Comparator.naturalOrder()) - is used to sort an array of objects in ascending order using the natural ordering defined by the objects' implementation of the Comparable interface.
arr.sort(Comparator.reverseOrder()) - reverse alphabatical order

var arr1 = arr.toArray(new String[arr.size()]) -  used to convert a List or Collection (arr) containing String elements into an array of Strings.
